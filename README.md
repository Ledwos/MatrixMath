Task 1: Matrix 
============

Create a javascript program to get an input of a (3X3) matrix, It should only allow unique values and not zero

You have to calculate the sum of the rows, columns and diagonal values of the matrix and print the sum

Also, you have to announce the winner if the sum of rows, columns and diagonal are the same.

Example below

    [
        [1,  2,  3],   | 6
        [5,  6,  7],   | 18 
        [8,  9,  4],   | 21
    ------------------|
    17   14  17  14     11
    ]

You can use node js readline to get the input from user, example here https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html
